Part I: Class design

Overload all appropriate operators for the classes from P2: jumpPrime and duelingJP
The class (type) definitions are the same EXCEPT now may encapsulate a 3-digit number as well as those of 4 or more digits.
A primary design goal is to streamline manipulation of jumpPrime and duelingJP objects.
Comparison should be widely supported for all types.
Addition MUST be supported consistently for both types: you decide the meaning and extent.

Consider, for example, if it is reasonable to: add a duelingJP to a duelingJP? a jumpPrime to a duelingJP? a jumpPrime to a jumpPrime? etc.
Determine the ripple effect(s) of supporting addition, including mixed-mode, short-cut assignment and pre & post increment. Make reasonable design decisions so that your classes satisfy the stated goals, communicate assumptions and use, and yield clear and maintainable software
Clearly, many, many details are missing. You must use operator overloading.

Use ProgrammingByContract to specify:
pre and post conditions; interface, implementation and class invariants.
Intent of operator overloading should be well-documented

Part II: Driver

Design a functionally decomposed driver to demonstrate program requirements.
Clearly specify the intent and structure of your driver
You should have arrays of distinct objects, initialized appropriately, i.e. random distribution of objects with arbitrary, initial, reasonable values
Meaningful values for non-arbitrary initial values, etc.
Do NOT use vectors, lists, etc.
